            <p>Exploring Angkor Wat</p>
            How to see Siem Reap, Cambodia
        </h1>
        <h1>Posted on May 1, 2018 </h1>
        <small>Angkor Wat had been on my bucket list for a long time. I’d dreamed of wandering among the ancient
            temples
            while
            entertaining romantic notions about the lives of the people who lived there more than 900 years ago.
            Built
            between <mark>1113 and 1153</mark>, the mammoth religious monument in <em><mark>Cambodia is a UNESCO
                    World</mark>
                Heritage Site
            </em>and the
            most
            visited attraction in Southeast Asia.

            My romantic notions were in part fueled by a fashion photo spread set amid the exotic temples I’d once
            seen
            in a
            glossy magazine. Luckily, my fancies were tempered by decades of travel experience and when I finally
            arrived at
            Angkor Wat, I was not dressed in a flowy white dress and high heels like the models, but instead clad
            head-to-toe in reliable REI gear.

            Visiting a popular cultural site is a lot like taking kids to Disneyland: go prepared or suffer the
            consequences. I couldn’t buy a Fastpass to Angkor Wat, but I did something even better. I pre-booked an
            expert
            guide and driver through the concierge at our hotel, and that made all the difference. Mr. Koy Vy
            reminded
            us of
            the essentials — sunscreen, hat, water bottle, insect repellent, snacks, and sturdy shoes — and insisted
            we
            start out before dawn. That seemed excessive until I saw the theme park-size ticket sales area, noted it
            was
            already hot before 8am, and witnessed the steady stream of tour buses that begins mid morning.</small>

        <h1><small>The south gate to Angkor Thom was built in the late 12th century</small></h1>
        <em> <br>The site encompasses 155 square miles and includes 93 temples, as well as ancient palaces,
            universities,
            hospitals, and sports fields — none of which are identified with signage. Guards stationed throughout the
            area
            check passes and use slingshots to shoo away monkeys, but they don’t provide directions or information. Most
            visitors stagger around in the humidity while reading the descriptions in their guidebooks, but my husband,
            our
            guide, and I were dropped off as close as permitted to the temples and talked about them as we walked and
            took
            photos. I was surprised to learn that Hinduism dominated here until it gave way to Buddhism in the 12th
            century,
            and also that archeologists surmise that draught and deforestation caused Angkor to be abandoned in the
            <mark>15th century </mark>. The residents moved to the coast and built a new city, Phnom Penh, the
            present-day
            capital of Cambodia.

        <br>While Angkor Wat is the main attraction, we thought the most appealing temples were farther off the beaten
        path.
        We were the only visitors at Preah Palilay, a very pretty Buddhist sanctuary in a wooded area north of the royal
        palace in Angkor Thom. I also liked the stone balustrades and carved deities on the small, unrestored Ta Nei
        Temple
        located near a holy reservoir. And I was positively enchanted by the ruins of Ta Prohm Temple, where massive
        gnarly
        roots and jungle trees wind in and out of the remaining structure.
        <h1><Mark>Cambodia</Mark></h1>
        <img src="/test.html/images .png" alt="">
        <br>Cambodia has a land area of 181,035 square kilometers in the southwestern part of the Indochina peninsula,
        about 20 percent of which is used for agriculture. It lies completely within the tropics with its southern
        most points slightly more than 10° above the Equator. The country capital city is Phnom Penh.

        International borders are shared with Thailand and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic on the West and the
        North, and the Social Republic of Viet Nam on the East and the Southeast. The country is bounded on the
        Southeast by the Gulf of Thailand. In comparison with neighbors, Cambodia is a geographical contact country
        administratively composed of 20 provinces, three of which have relatively short maritime boundaries, 2
        municipalities, 172 districts, and 1,547 communes. The country has a coastline of 435 km and extensive
        mangrove stands, some of which are relatively undisturbed.

        The dominant features of the Cambodian landscape are the large, almost generally located, Tonle Sap (Great
        Lake) and the Bassac River Systems and the Mekong River, which crosses the country from North to South.
        Surrounding the Central Plains which covered three quarters of the country’s area are the more densely
        forested and sparsely populated highlands, comprising: the Elephant Mountains and Cardamom Mountain of the
        southwest and western regions; the Dangrek Mountains of the North adjoining of the Korat Plateau of
        Thailand; and Rattanakiri Plateau and Chhlong highlands on the east merging with the Central Highlands of
        Viet Nam.
